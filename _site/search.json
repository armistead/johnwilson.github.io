Each year, the dashboard will be updated with new demographic data based on applications and admissions, provided by UCSB’s Graduate Division, and post-grad career placement data from the Bren’s Career Services Team.\nIn January 2023, I took over as the primary dashboard maintainer. This involved refactoring the code base, processing new data, and updating the dashboard. Some additional refactoring is likely to happen during the next big update in order to further simplify the code base and improve readability for future maintainers.\nCheck back each year to learn more about our Bren students!"

I worked closely with Julie Lowndes (founding director of Openscapes) and Stefanie Butland (core Openscapes team member) to bring their vision to life and it was seriously such a fun project. I wrote a blog post about my experience / some of the highlights. Check it out!\n\n\n\nSanta Ynez River, Santa Barbara, CA, where Julie and I spent time brainstorming ideas for the Openscapes website"
