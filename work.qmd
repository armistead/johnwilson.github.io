# Background
Originally from Concord, Massachusetts, I went to college in Los Angeles where I [freelanced](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4911200/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_1_q_john%2520armistead%2520wilson) and played music until I managed to join a tech start-up for live event tickets called [ScoreBig](https://www.scorebig.com/). That is where I fell in love with analytics, engaging with data to reach our first million customers. Finally I wanted to expand my horizons, so I moved to Nashville for my MBA, and the rest is history.
