One under-estimated aspect of working in Senior Housing is the management of real estate data. For effective property management and ownership, the data teams need to be structured for effective collaboration -- but not too much, as I talk about in this interview.

<!-- # What's on the dashboard? -->

<!-- This is very much an ongoing work in-progress, but the first version included a "Gear Garage" for tracking mileage on my hiking boots and bike, an activity heat map of all recorded hikes, bike rides, and walks, visualizations for exploring activity distance and elevation gain, and an interactive table of the raw data. -->

<!-- There are many more visualizations and features I'd love to add (but have been severely lacking the time to do so). I also still manually retrieve new activities using the Strava API via the [`{rstrava}` package](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava), but I hope to automate this in the next version. Stay tuned! -->
