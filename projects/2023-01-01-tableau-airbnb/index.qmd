To explore Nashville Airbnb market, I put some Tableau skills to use.

<!-- # What's on the dashboard? -->

<!-- This is very much an ongoing work in-progress, but the first version included a "Gear Garage" for tracking mileage on my hiking boots and bike, an activity heat map of all recorded hikes, bike rides, and walks, visualizations for exploring activity distance and elevation gain, and an interactive table of the raw data. -->

<!-- There are many more visualizations and features I'd love to add (but have been severely lacking the time to do so). I also still manually retrieve new activities using the Strava API via the [`{rstrava}` package](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava), but I hope to automate this in the next version. Stay tuned! -->
