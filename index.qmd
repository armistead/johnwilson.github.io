Hi, my name's John Wilson, and I am a strategy and analytics executive based in Nashville, TN. Here you'll find info about my work as director of insights and analytics with Brookdale Senior Living as well as my side projects. I am passionate about the intersection of people and technology, specifically in the hospitality and real estate industry. When I am not doing data, I am probably with my family trying new plant-based foods or out exploring Music City.
